    ``local_scan`` is the result of :func:`scan_installed`. Local findings
    describe the exact installed bytes, so wherever the local scan reached a
    verdict it **replaces** the index's: a domain the index never heard of that
    parses clean becomes ``clean``, and an index finding disappears when the
    installed copy no longer contains it. Only a domain the local scan could
    not read falls back to the index, and if neither side knows it, it stays in
    ``not_in_index`` with the local reason. A local ``clean`` reached with zero
    matchable rules in play proves nothing and never overrides the index.

    ``current_version`` is the Home Assistant release this system runs, and
    ``today`` the current date. Together they sort every finding into three
    levels:

    ``broken_now``  the running version has already reached the deadline. This
                    is decided by version comparison alone -- never by a date
                    estimate -- so it is exact.
    ``imminent``    still ahead, but the release is estimated to land within
                    ``alert_window_days``. Worth an alert of its own.
    ``upcoming``    further out. Summarised in one group rather than alerted
                    on individually, because a year-ahead deadline that cannot
                    be dismissed just teaches people to ignore the panel.

    Without a version or a date, findings degrade conservatively to
    ``upcoming`` rather than guessing.

    Returns a plain dict ready to become the sensor's state and attributes.
    Unknown or malformed index payloads degrade to an empty report rather than
    raising -- the caller decides whether that is an error.
